                        <p><h2> Section: Large Language Model inference optimization</h2><h3> Question: What are the latest developments around large language model inference and quantization?</h3><p> LLM response: The latest developments around large language model inference and quantization include the emergent ability of GPT-4 to interpret complex novel metaphors, as demonstrated in the study by Ichien et al. (2023), the investigation of arithmetic computation capabilities of language models, as shown in the work by Maltoni et al. (2023), and the exploration of correction as a task for large language models in the context of natural language processing, as examined in the research by Zhang et al. (2023).</p><h4> Papers </h4><ul><li> Large Language Model Displays Emergent Ability to Interpret Novel

Etxaniz et al. 2023</li></ul><h2> Section: Large Language Model and medicine</h2><h3> Question: What are the latest developments around large language models and medicine?</h3><p> LLM response: The latest developments around large language models and medicine include the use of local LLMs to tackle complex, domain-specific tasks in the medical field, such as extracting structured condition codes from pathology reports (Bumgardner, 2023). Additionally, large language models have shown an emergent ability to interpret complex novel metaphors in literature, outperforming college students in providing detailed and incisive interpretations (Ichien, 2023). Furthermore, LLMs explicitly trained on large corpuses of medical knowledge have demonstrated the capability to predict psychiatric functioning from patient interviews and clinical descriptions, with performance comparable to human clinical raters (Galatzer-Levy, 2023).</p><h4> Papers </h4><ul><li> Local Large Language Models for Complex Structured Medical Tasks.
